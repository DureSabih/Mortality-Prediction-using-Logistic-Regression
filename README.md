This project aims to train a model that can make accurate prediction on the mortality of heart failure patients given values of the features. EDA is conducted to reveal correlation of features, proceeded with  application of machine learning classifiers to predict the survival and identify the risk factors leading  to the death event. 

Python 3 ipy kernel of Jupyter is used
Dataset used for this task called ‘Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset’ was sourced from UCI, (UCI 
Repository, n.d.). Credits to original creators of dataset;Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider 
Bhatti, Muhammad Aftab, and Muhammad Ali Raza (Government College University, Faisalabad, 
Pakistan).
