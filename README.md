# Mortality-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to train a model that can make accurate prediction on the mortality of heart failure patients given values of the features. EDA is conducted to reveal correlation of features, proceeded with  application of machine learning classifiers to predict the survival and identify the risk factors leading  to the death event.
